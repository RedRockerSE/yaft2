# Plugin Ideas
This document is used for documenting ideas for new plugin.

## Plugins to develop
- Parser for UnifiedLogs from an iOS-device-extraction. Should work with zip-files in both Cellebrite and Graykey-formats
- DeviceInformation - As much useful deviceinformation as possible extracted from device-extractions (zip-files). Versions for both Android and iOS is needed.

  
## Done
